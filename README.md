# MemoryManagement

This program emulates a virtual memory system using page/frame table with a FIFO algorithm for allocation

To use the program, run the .exe then you will be prompted for a logical memory address
Upon entering a logical address, the program will print out the physical address translation as well as the page number and offset
to exit the program enter -1 or an invalid logical address, and the program will halt.
